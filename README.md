DECAF is a bioinformatics tool designed for the classification and decontamination of plant Internal Transcribed Spacer (ITS) DNA sequences. Leveraging deep learning models, DECAF accurately identifies and filters out contaminants from environmental samples, improving the reliability of downstream analyses.

## Key Features

- **Plant ITS Sequence Classification:** Accurately classifies ITS sequences belonging to plants.
- **Contaminant Detection & Filtering:** Identifies and removes non-target sequences.
- **Supports Common Formats:** Works with FASTQ and FASTA file formats.
- **Command-Line Interface:** Easy to integrate into bioinformatics pipelines.
- **Modular Design:** Built with a modular architecture, allowing for potential future extensions to other genetic markers and taxa.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository (Optional):**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Aaramis/DECAF.git
   cd DECAF
   ```

2. **Create a Virtual Environment:**
   It's highly recommended to use a virtual environment to manage dependencies.

   - On Windows:
     ```bash
     python -m venv decaf-env
     decaf-env\Scripts\activate
     ```
   - On macOS and Linux:
     ```bash
     python -m venv decaf-env
     source decaf-env/bin/activate
     ```

3. **Install Dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Quick Start

Basic usage instructions will be added here soon. This will include examples like:

```bash
# Example command structure (TO BE UPDATED)
# decaf process --input your_sequences.fastq --output cleaned_sequences.fastq --model its_plant_model
```

For detailed usage instructions, please refer to the full documentation.

## Documentation

Comprehensive documentation for DECAF is available at:
https://Aaramis.github.io/DECAF/

To build and view the documentation locally:

1. Ensure you have installed the development dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
   (You might want a separate requirements-dev.txt for docs and testing tools)

2. Serve the documentation:
   ```bash
   mkdocs serve
   ```
   Then open your browser to http://127.0.0.1:8000.
